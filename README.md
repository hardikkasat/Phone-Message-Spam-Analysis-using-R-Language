Developed a system for analyzing and predicting spam messages using various machine learning models. The system classifies text messages as spam or non-spam based on features like message content and length. Implemented a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions using the Shiny package in R. 
Tech Used: R, Shiny package for the interactive web app, dplyr for data manipulation, caret for model training, and multiple machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Trees.
